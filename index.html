        <div class="subheading mb-5">Public PolicyðŸ“œ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! My name is Isaac Galeano and Iâ€™m a first year Public Policy major at the University of California Riverside. I am one of three brothers in my small family of 5 and the first one to attend college. I was born and raised in SoCal, more specifically in Orange County, where I attended public school and ultimately enrolled at UCR. Although I do not have experience within a job, I excel when it comes to extra curricular activities as well as board positions within organizations and clubs.<br><br>
	To start off, I was a mentor for high school students for three years. I mentored in this program called the Junior Ambassadors from my sophomore to senior year. Our goal is to provide authentic leadership experiences that unlock the inner potential of youth to be responsible and passionate leaders who impact positive change in the community. As a mentor, I had to watch over and guide 3 high school students stemming from different communities in Orange County. As a mentor, I would consistently call my mentees and discuss their goals with them. I had to make sure that they attended meetings, went to the community service opportunities, and potentially run for board of the program. Also, as a mentor, I worked within a team of around 9 more mentors, discussing future community service opportunities to implement as well as contribute to what the monthly meetings will consist of. 
<br><br>

        Next, I was secretary for my schoolâ€™s Latinos Unidos club. This club is meant to empower Latinx students educationally, socially, and culturally. Being on board for this club meant representing not only the Latinos in a majority white school, but also representing them in the entire school district. The Latinos Unidos club likes to throw district wide cultural events where each LU club can dance, sing, or sell food. As secretary, I would have to coordinate with school superintendents to get the word out as well as get the necessary equipment like tables, speakers, tents, etc. At school during meetings, I had to keep track of attendance as well as assist the president and vice president in making presentations and schedules for the aforementioned meetings.<br><br>

        Lastly, throughout my junior and senior year of high school, I was president of AVID. AVID is a program in which they educate students on what itâ€™s like to be in college, the effects, prices, etc. Not only that, but AVID prepares students to apply to college and helps them sign up for FAFSA. As AVID president, It was my job to find fundraisers to help us students go on field trips to schools around the area. It was especially difficult during my junior year when we needed funds to go up north to visit schools like UC Berkeley, Stanford, and San Francisco State University. Also, it was also important for me to communicate with the administration office, reporting data to them about our program as well as receiving information about county wide events that involved the students.
